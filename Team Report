Team Report
As a member of the group I was writing following interrupt handlers functions: Tro, Svc, DiskInt. Also, during project I was participating in debugging code (Quality Assurance) and discussions.
My teammates were doing debugging as well and also they were writing following:
Andrew: Swapper and Scheduler classes and Drmint interrupt handler function;
Tofic: he was a true leader of the group and was “pushing” project forward, he was writing (os, PCB and FreeSpace) and take care of the all code including our functions and classes.
Finally, all members of the group were participating in debugging code, and in discussion and fixing it.
